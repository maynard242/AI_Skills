### Slide 9: Security Teams - AI Security & Governance

**Objective**: Define security and governance skills needed to protect AI systems and ensure responsible AI implementation.

**Layout Composition**:
The slide is a flex-col with a header sized to its content, a main body that grows, and a footer sized to its content. The main body is a grid with two columns (1fr 1fr) and three rows (auto auto auto). Top row spans both columns for security overview, middle row has two threat categories, bottom row has governance and compliance.
