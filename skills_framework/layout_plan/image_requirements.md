# Image Requirements Summary

## Analysis

After careful review of all 16 slides in this AI Skills Framework presentation, **no informative images are required or justified**.

## Rationale

This presentation is focused on:
- **Conceptual frameworks and decision tools** (personas, decision trees, assessment matrices)
- **Abstract capability definitions** (skill lists, competency levels, training pathways)
- **Organizational process and strategy** (implementation roadmap, training programs)
- **Comparative data** (role matrices, cloud service comparisons, competency tables)

All of this content is best served through:
- **Text-based component schemas** (cards, lists, structured frameworks)
- **Tables and matrices** (for comparisons and assessments)
- **Decision tree visualizations** (rendered as structured text components)
- **Timeline/roadmap components** (text-based with visual styling)

## Image Justification Assessment

Applying the Informative-First Framework:

1. **Direct Illustration of Subject**: This presentation does not discuss specific products, locations, people, or physical objects that would benefit from photography.

2. **Visualization of Process/System**: While there are processes described (ML pipelines, decision trees), these are better served by code-rendered diagrams with text labels rather than static images. The dynamic nature of the content requires flexibility that programmatic rendering provides.

3. **Real-World Context**: The framework is abstract and organizational. There are no specific real-world installations, equipment, or locations that need photographic context.

## Potential "Cheesy" Images Avoided

The following image types were considered but correctly rejected as non-informative:
- Generic photos of people in meetings or training sessions
- Abstract representations of "AI" or "technology" (brain networks, glowing circuits)
- Stock photos of diverse teams collaborating
- Metaphorical images for concepts like "skills," "growth," or "transformation"
- Generic cloud infrastructure or data center photos

## Conclusion

**No images required.** 

All visual communication needs in this presentation are better served through:
- Structured text components with strong information hierarchy
- Code-rendered tables and matrices
- Programmatic visualizations of decision trees and timelines
- Color-coded role distinctions and progression indicators
- Icon usage from lucide-react for visual anchoring

This approach ensures maximum clarity, consistency, and maintainability while avoiding the addition of decorative or "cheesy" imagery that would not enhance understanding.
