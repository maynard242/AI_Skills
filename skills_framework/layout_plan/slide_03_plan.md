### Slide 3: AI Personas - AI Citizens vs AI Workers

**Objective**: Introduce the two primary AI capability personas from the Turing Institute framework and help teams identify where roles fit.

**Layout Composition**:
The slide is a flex-col with a header sized to its content, a main body that grows, and a footer sized to its content. The main body is a grid with two columns (1fr 1fr) for the two personas, with a connecting visual element between them.
