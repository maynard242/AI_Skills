### Slide 2: Framework Overview & Strategic Context

**Objective**: Establish why AI skills matter for IT teams and introduce the core principles guiding this framework.

**Layout Composition**:
The slide is a flex-col with a header sized to its content, a main body that grows to fill remaining space, and a footer sized to its content. The main body is a grid with two columns in a 1fr 1fr ratio and two rows in a auto 1fr proportion. This creates four areas: top-left for context, top-right for strategic drivers, bottom-left for framework principles, and bottom-right for key dimensions.
