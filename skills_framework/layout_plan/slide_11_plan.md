  - Creative Brief: Bold title text-6xl, subtitle text-3xl with 70% opacity. White text.

- Block 2:
  - Block Type: Table
  - Placement: Main body area, growing to fill available space
  - Data:
    Headers: ["AI Capability", "AWS", "Azure", "Google Cloud", "Use Case"]
    Rows: [
      ["ML Platform", "SageMaker", "Azure Machine Learning", "Vertex AI", "End-to-end ML lifecycle"],
      ["Pre-trained Vision", "Rekognition", "Computer Vision", "Vision AI", "Image/video analysis"],

      ["Model Monitoring", "Model Monitor", "Model Monitoring", "Vertex AI Model Monitoring", "Drift detection, performance"],
      ["Recommendation", "Personalize", "Personalizer", "Recommendations AI", "Personalized recommendations"]
    ]
  - Creative Brief: Professional enterprise table with clear structure. Header row with slate-700 background and bold white text (text-xl). Use subtle cloud provider brand colors for the provider columns: orange tint for AWS, blue for Azure, multi-color for Google Cloud. Alternate row background colors (slate-800/slate-750) for readability. Text size text-lg for table cells. Last column (Use Case) slightly wider to accommodate descriptions. Add subtle borders between columns. Ensure the table is highly scannable with good spacing.
